# 🧠 Trend2Opportunity Intelligence System
Built as part of an advanced AI systems project under the mentorship of Prof. Purushottam Kar.

## 🔍 Overview

**Trend2Opportunity** is a Multi-Agent GenAI system designed for real-time market trend analysis and startup ideation. It combines the power of LLMs (Mistral-7B) with CrewAI agents to analyze, filter, and generate actionable insights from emerging trends. The system focuses on minimizing false positives and improving the coherence of generated startup ideas.
